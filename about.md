AClang is a research project conducted at the University of Campinas
([IC-UNICAMP](http://ic.unicamp.br/)) in Brazil. It is based on the
open-source LLVM/Clang compiler framework and implements
the OpenMP 4.0 Accelerator Programming Model. ACLang automatically
converts OpenMP annotated program regions into OpenCL/SPIR kernels,
while providing a set of polyhedral based optimizations like tiling
and vectorization. OpenCL kernels resulting from ACLang can be
executed on any OpenCL/SPIR compatible acceleration device, not only
GPUs, but also FPGA accelerators like those found in the Intel HARP
architecture.
